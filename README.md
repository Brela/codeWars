## week 10-23-2022
<strong>10-25</strong> 
<strong>10-24</strong> added some css mobile queries | fixed part of hover problem by moving from css :hover to JS mouseenter/ mouselave

## week 10-17-2022
<strong>10-23</strong> Got it to work! Items now toggle upon click of their list item - see 10-23 on website or in 10-23.js for code behind it. Need to fix :hover to display preview of item

<strong>10-22</strong> Still trying to figure out adding "display: block" to an item and removing that class from the rest at the same time

<strong>10-20</strong> X's vs Os | 10-19 Enter Words and Sort | 10-18 Enter numbers and sort | <strong>10-17</strong> Cat and Dog Years Conversion 

* working on layout
* first 7kyu codeWars challenge!
Spent many hours trying to figure out displaying each daily entry; I found the problem was shown on the console (that a variabloe was already declared because I forgot to unlink my test JS file) 
* always check the console for any problems
