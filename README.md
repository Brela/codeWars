# codeWars
Here is a collection of my coding challenges<br>
The purpose of this is to track my journey of learning JavaScript
Some challenges appear on the site, while others are just in a JS file
## Live Site: <a href="https://brela-codewars.netlify.app/" target="_blank">brela-codewars.netlify.app</a>

### Notes
* main.js - JS to make list items with stars ⭐ work (usually with user input) 
* script.js - JS/ jQuery code to make functions for the whole page and layout work
* DailyJScode Folder - each JS file in this folder is a diffferent coding challenge or a week's collection of coding challenges
